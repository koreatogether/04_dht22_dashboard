# Requirements Document

## Introduction

DHT22 지능형 온습도 모니터링 시스템은 Arduino UNO R4 WiFi와 DHT22 센서를 활용하여 온도와 습도를 실시간으로 측정하고, 고급 데이터 분석을 수행하며, 웹 대시보드를 통해 시각화하는 산업용 수준의 모니터링 시스템입니다. 이 시스템은 INA219 전력 모니터링 시스템의 검증된 아키텍처를 기반으로 온습도 모니터링에 최적화되어 개발됩니다.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to monitor temperature and humidity in real-time through a web dashboard, so that I can ensure optimal environmental conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL establish connection with DHT22 sensor and display real-time temperature and humidity data
2. WHEN sensor data is received THEN the system SHALL update the web dashboard within 1 second
3. WHEN temperature exceeds 28°C or falls below 18°C THEN the system SHALL trigger a visual alert
4. WHEN humidity exceeds 70% or falls below 30% THEN the system SHALL trigger a visual alert
5. WHEN the web dashboard is accessed THEN it SHALL display current temperature, humidity, heat index, and dew point values

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want to view historical temperature and humidity data with interactive charts, so that I can analyze environmental trends over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN historical data is requested THEN the system SHALL provide data for the last 48 hours
2. WHEN viewing history charts THEN the user SHALL be able to select time ranges (1H, 6H, 24H, 48H)
3. WHEN interacting with charts THEN the user SHALL be able to zoom, pan, and export data to CSV
4. WHEN displaying historical data THEN the system SHALL show both raw measurements and statistical summaries
5. WHEN data is older than 48 hours THEN the system SHALL automatically clean up old records

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a facility manager, I want to receive intelligent alerts based on data analysis, so that I can proactively address environmental issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN temperature or humidity shows abnormal patterns THEN the system SHALL detect outliers using Z-score and IQR methods
2. WHEN outliers are detected THEN the system SHALL display alerts with severity levels (mild, moderate, severe)
3. WHEN calculating moving averages THEN the system SHALL provide 1-minute, 5-minute, and 15-minute averages
4. WHEN heat index exceeds 27°C THEN the system SHALL display caution level alert
5. WHEN heat index exceeds 32°C THEN the system SHALL display extreme caution level alert
6. WHEN heat index exceeds 40°C THEN the system SHALL display danger level alert

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test the system without physical hardware, so that I can develop and debug the application efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running in simulation mode THEN the system SHALL generate realistic DHT22 sensor data
2. WHEN selecting simulation modes THEN the system SHALL support NORMAL, HOT_DRY, COLD_WET, EXTREME_HOT, EXTREME_COLD, and FLUCTUATING conditions
3. WHEN in NORMAL mode THEN the system SHALL generate temperature between 20-25°C and humidity between 40-60%
4. WHEN in HOT_DRY mode THEN the system SHALL generate temperature between 30-40°C and humidity between 20-40%
5. WHEN in EXTREME conditions THEN the system SHALL generate appropriate extreme values to test alert systems

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want the system to store and manage data efficiently, so that I can ensure reliable operation and data integrity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sensor data is received THEN the system SHALL store it in SQLite database with timestamp, temperature, humidity, heat index, and dew point
2. WHEN storing minute statistics THEN the system SHALL calculate and store min, max, and average values for each minute
3. WHEN alert events occur THEN the system SHALL log them with timestamp, type, severity, and resolution status
4. WHEN database size grows THEN the system SHALL automatically clean up data older than 48 hours
5. WHEN system starts THEN the database SHALL be automatically initialized with proper tables and indexes

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an end user, I want to access the monitoring system through a modern web interface, so that I can easily view and interact with the data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the web dashboard THEN it SHALL display real-time charts using Chart.js with temperature, humidity, and heat index
2. WHEN viewing real-time data THEN the charts SHALL update automatically every second via WebSocket connection
3. WHEN displaying metrics THEN the system SHALL use color-coded indicators (green for normal, yellow for caution, red for danger)
4. WHEN showing statistics THEN the dashboard SHALL display 1-minute statistics with min/max values
5. WHEN analyzing data THEN the dashboard SHALL show moving averages and outlier detection results

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to deploy the system using Docker containers, so that I can ensure consistent deployment across different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building the application THEN it SHALL use multi-stage Docker build with separate development and production stages
2. WHEN running in production THEN the container SHALL be optimized for minimal size and resource usage
3. WHEN deploying with Docker Compose THEN it SHALL support both development and production configurations
4. WHEN container starts THEN it SHALL automatically initialize the database and start all required services
5. WHEN running in development mode THEN it SHALL support hot reload and debugging capabilities

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want the system to maintain high code quality and reliability, so that I can ensure robust operation in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is written THEN it SHALL follow Python best practices using Ruff and Black formatters
2. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL achieve at least 80% code coverage
3. WHEN handling errors THEN the system SHALL implement proper exception handling and logging
4. WHEN processing sensor data THEN it SHALL validate input data and handle sensor failures gracefully
5. WHEN operating in production THEN it SHALL disable debug features and API documentation for security
